# Brian Kilpatrick's React Portfolio  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

This is my updated, professional online portfolio, that showcases my skills as a web developer.
In this portfolio, the user will find links to projects I have worked on, information about me, my resume, and how he/she can contact me.
